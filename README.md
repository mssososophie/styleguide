# Telcom Styleguide
This guide is a set of standards that should be used in how we as a company communicate to one another and to the public. This guide is likely to continuously change so please be sure to refer back to it regularly.

If you think that there is something missing, let us know by [raising an issue](https://github.com/telcomuk/styleguide/issues) (for the geeks) or emailing [hr@telcom.io](mailto:hr@telcom.io).


## Style

### Font
[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)

### Colour
Blue: [Pantone 2174-C](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/2174-C) // #0076CE // cmyk(94,43,0,0) //  rgb(0,118,206)

### Imagery types
Traditional imagery in this area is boring. Try to avoid wherever possible the use of any stereotypical/stock looking business or connectivity imagery. Try to use high quality, good resolution, well composed, natural looking images from sources like [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/search/puppies) . Try to use images of the world we want to create; Images that people having a good life might see, from beautiful scenery to cool looking offices and comfortable homes.

Because connectivity can be difficult to envision (or not interesting to look at), use of metaphorical imagery (eg *'freedom'* = person standing in open space // *'fast'* = light trails or lightening ), or look at what people can do with our services (Drones, invention, watch a movie together etc).

### Logo
You can grab the main logo files from the [logofiles folder](/logofiles).

General guidelines:
* Use vectors where possible
* Don't distort the logo... ever.

Positioning the logo can be a bit tricky. Some tips:
* Keep a lot of whitespace around it
* Be careful if you centre it - you tend to need to move it left of centre a little to keep it balanced (due to tail of star)
* It tends to look good when used white over coloured backgrounds / imagery provided it is visible
* If you are just centring the mark (the star) without the text, centre the tip of the star - don't just centre align the image


## Language
* **Always evoke a feeling of stability / improvement over everything else.** Customers trust us to manage one of the core foundations of their business - we need to ensure they know we take this responsibility seriously and that they can rely on us to do so.
* Speak plainly and intelligently
* Be forward thinking, but not head in the clouds
* Talk about a realistic world we can help build with our technology
* Be positive in language. If you have to criticise a system, focus on about how it can be made better, not only that it is bad.
